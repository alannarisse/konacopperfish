History Of Bob 
Bob was born in Sothern California and grew up in his fathers sheet metal shop. Soon after graduating high school he moved to Kona Hawaii. There, Bob was well known as an acomplished surfer. He then started traveling to Iliamna Alaska for work in the summer months. There, he gained a huge love for the salmon and rainbow fishing in the world famous Newhalen River. This inspired him to start making his copper fish. For two decades he worked in alaska, caught world class fish and reproduced those fish in copper. Today Bob is happily retired in beatiful Kona Hawaii making copper fish ranging in species from  the cold water rainbow trout to the tropical Humuhumunukunukuapua`a. What will Bob do next? well, you will have to ask him.
